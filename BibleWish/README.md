# BibleWish 

BibleWish was created with a simple and uncompromising purpose:

To make the Word of God freely accessible, without distraction, monetization,
or commercial interest.

This project is not a product, a startup, or a platform for profit.
It is a service — offered freely, as a gift — in obedience to the principle:

> “Freely you have received; freely give.” (Matthew 10:8)


### ✝️ Vision

BibleWish is designed to help people read, track, and engage with the Bible in
a clean, focused, and respectful way. There are no ads, no paid features, no
hidden monetization, and no intention to commercialize Scripture.

The source code is open for learning, study, and contribution so that others
may grow — technically and spiritually — but it may not be used for commercial
purposes.

If BibleWish helps even one person read the Bible more faithfully, more
consistently, or with greater understanding, then its purpose is fulfilled.

### Bible Translation Support

At the moment, BibleWish supports the **King James Version (KJV)** of the Bible.

This choice is intentional. The KJV text is in the public domain, which allows
it to be freely used, shared, and distributed without licensing restrictions.
This aligns with the core mission of BibleWish: providing free and unrestricted
access to God’s Word.

Support for additional Bible translations is planned for the future. Any new
translations added will be limited to versions that are legally open and free
to distribute, respecting both copyright law and the integrity of Scripture.

Our goal is to expand translation support responsibly, while preserving the
principle of free access for everyone.


All glory belongs to God.

God bless y’all. 🙏🏻
